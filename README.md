# Shipping & Profitability Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of shipping costs, revenues, and profitability across multiple merchants and carriers. The goal is to identify pricing anomalies, calculate net margins after fuel surcharges and returns, and analyze weight discrepancies between revenue and costing.

## Key Features
- **Data Standardization:** Conversion of multiple local currencies into USD.
- **Profitability Metrics:** Calculation of shipping margin before and after returns.
- **Surcharge Logic:** Implementation of fuel surcharges (4%-7%) and Remote Area fees ($2) based on specific merchant/carrier logic.
- **Weight Delta Analysis:** Comparison of "Revenue Weight" vs. "Costing Weight" to identify reconciliation gaps.

## File Structure
- `data.csv`: The raw dataset containing shipping orders.
- `tasks.csv`: Business requirements and logic definitions.
- `answer1-3.csv`: Processed results and analytical summaries.
- `Pricing Analysis.xlsx`: The complete workbook with pivot tables and final insights.

## Tools Used
