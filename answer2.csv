This dramatic swing suggests that return costs completely eliminate the margin and generate significant losses.
Based on average volumes, the estimated financial impact is approximately $1,500 per month (≈ $18,000 per year).
Recommendation: Global-e should review return policies, renegotiate terms, or consider switching carriers for this merchant-channel combination.",,,,,,,,,,,
